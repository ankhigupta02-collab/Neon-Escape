## Overview

**Neon Escape** is a level-based maze navigation game where the player must find the correct route from the **start tile** to the **end tile**.

Every time the player reaches the end point, the level is marked as **completed**, and the game automatically loads the **next maze**.

The game is built using:
- **HTML** → structure  
- **CSS** → styling & neon theme  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** → logic, movement & level progression

## Key Features

### Multiple Levels**
Each level has a unique maze layout that becomes slightly more challenging.

###  Player Movement**
Move in four directions (Up, Down, Left, Right) using keyboard controls.

### Fog of War System (Visibility Mode)**
A special feature that increases difficulty.

You can:
- **Enable Fog of War** → Only 2.8 units around the player are visible (limited visibility)
- **Disable Fog of War** → Entire maze becomes visible (easy mode)

This provides two ways to play:
- **Hard Mode** (fog enabled)  
- **Easy Mode** (fog disabled)

###  ** Pure Browser Game**
No installations needed — runs directly in the browser.

###  ** No Sound Effects, No Hazards**
The game is simple and clean:
- No enemies  
- No traps  
- No fire/water  
- No additional dangers  
Just pure maze navigation.
